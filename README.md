# What is "The Ion Project"?
*The Ion Project* is a project containing **Proton**, **Neutron**, **Electron** and **Photon**. These are created using *Skript 2.2* and *skQuery* only, I try to stay away from other addons.

## What are some of the features?
Ion is a recreation of **Essentials**, within Skript 2.2 & skQuery. It contains features such as /vanish, /tp, /tpcoords, and many more.

## What is Proton, Neutron, Electron & Photon for?
Ion is split-up into (currently) 4 Separate modules.

* **Proton** currently contains *95%* of all commands within **Ion**
* **Neutron** is the Chat Manager of Ion. Still in the works, but currently allows player's with the permission to create chat groups and add people to them
* **Electron** is an economy system. A fairly straight-forward system with /pay and /balance.
* **Photon** is the newest module *(As of v1.3)* that is a replacer for some Minecraft Vanilla commands, like /gamerule. There are now per-world settings by using the /worldSettings and aswell /globalSettings
